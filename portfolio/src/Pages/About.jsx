        Hello! My name is Ranjan Yadav, I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back last year when I
        was trying to edit things on the web - taught me a lot about HTML &
        CSS!. Fast forwarding to today, I built a number of web applications and
        3 Major projects. Learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership and
        communication. After months of rigorous training, here I am looking for
        an opportunity as a full stack web developer.
